### **Joint IEEE, ISOC, W3C, IETF and IAB Definition**

On August 12, 2012, the [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers) (IEEE), [Internet Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Society) (ISOC), [World Wide Web Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium) (W3C), [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) (IETF) and [Internet Architecture Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Architecture_Board) (IAB), jointly affirmed a set of principles which have contributed to the [exponential growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth) of the Internet and related technologies. The &quot;OpenStand Principles&quot; define open standards and establish the building blocks for innovation.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard#cite_note-6) Standards developed using the OpenStand principles are developed through an open, participatory process, support interoperability, foster global competition, are voluntarily adopted on a global level and serve as building blocks for products and services targeted to meet the needs of markets and consumers. This drives innovation which, in turn, contributes to the creation of new markets and the growth and expansion of existing markets.

**There are five, key OpenStand Principles, as outlined below:**

### 1. Cooperation

Respectful cooperation between standards organizations, whereby each respects the autonomy, integrity, processes, and intellectual property rules of the others.

### 2. Adherence to Principles

Adherence to the five fundamental principles of standards development, namely

- **Due process:** Decisions are made with equity and fairness among participants. No one party dominates or guides standards development. Standards processes are transparent and opportunities exist to appeal decisions. Processes for periodic standards review and updating are well defined.
- **Broad consensus:** Processes allow for all views to be considered and addressed, such that agreement can be found across a range of interests.
- **Transparency:** Standards organizations provide advance public notice of proposed standards development activities, the scope of work to be undertaken, and conditions for participation. Easily accessible records of decisions and the materials used in reaching those decisions are provided. Public comment periods are provided before final standards approval and adoption.
- **Balance:** Standards activities are not exclusively dominated by any particular person, company or interest group.
- **Openness:** Standards processes are open to all interested and informed parties.

### 3. Collective Empowerment

Commitment by affirming standards organizations and their participants to collective empowerment by striving for standards that:

- are chosen and defined based on technical merit, as judged by the contributed expertise of each participant;
- provide global interoperability, scalability, stability, and resiliency;
- enable global competition;
- serve as building blocks for further innovation; and
- contribute to the creation of global communities, benefiting humanity.

### 4. Availability

Standards specifications are made accessible to all for implementation and deployment. Affirming standards organizations have defined procedures to develop specifications that can be implemented under fair terms. Given market diversity, fair terms may vary from royalty-free to [fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair,_reasonable,_and_non-discriminatory) terms (FRAND).

### 5. Voluntary Adoption

Standards are voluntarily adopted and success is determined by the market.
