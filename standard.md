**2. Use of Approved Open Licenses** | Digital public goods must demonstrate the use of an approved open license. For open-source software, only [OSI approved licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses) are accepted. For open content collections the use of a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) is required. DPGs are encourageed to use a license that allows for both derivatives and commercial reuse ([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)), or dedicate content to the public domain ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/)); licenses that do not allow for commercial reuse ([CC-BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) and [CC-BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)) are also accepted.

**3. Clear Ownership** | Ownership of assets that the digital public good produces must be clearly defined and documented. For example, through copyright, trademark or other publicly available information.
**4. Platform Independence** | When the digital public good has mandatory dependencies that create more restrictions than the original license, proving independence from the closed component(s) and/or indicating the existence of functional, open alternatives that can be used without significant changes to the core product is required.
**5. Documentation** | Digital public goods require documentation of the source code, use cases, and/or functional requirements. For content collections, this should include all relevant/compatible apps, software, or hardware required to access the content collection, and instructions regarding how to use it. For software solutions, this should be technical documentation that would allow a technical person unfamiliar with the project to launch and run the software. For data projects, this should be documentation that describes all the fields in the set, and provides context on how the dataset was collected, and how it should be interpreted.

**9. Do No Harm By Design** | Digital Public Goods must be designed to anticipate, prevent, and do no harm by design.
**9a) Data Privacy & Security** | Digital Public Goods that collect data must indicate the types of data collected and stored. DPGs must demonstrate how they are designed to ensure that the privacy and security of this data, in addition to how to the design of the DPG mitigates and prevents adverse impacts that can result from data collection, storage and distribution.
**9b) Inappropriate & Illegal Content** | Digital Public Goods designed to collect, store or distribute content collections must have policies for identifying inappropriate, harmful and illegal content collections (i.e child sexual abuse materials) in addition to mechanisms for detecting, moderating and removing inappropriate/illegal content.
**9c) Protection from Harassment** | When Digital Public Goods facilitate interactions with or between users or contributors, they are required to have a mechanism for users and contributors to protect themselves against grief, abuse, and harassment. In addition, DPGs must have a mechanism to address the safety and security of underage users.
